## Simple C++ Rendering Engine for learning purposes. 

### TODO :
- remove GLUT ✔
- remove prebuilt glew binaries ✔
- cmake ✔
- renderdoc ✔ (uniforms are always zero when reading *shrugging*)
- fix pbr new bug after refactor, diff roughness ✔
- hide renderers impl inside and clean the interface ✔
- get samplers in
- define _DEBUG macro in debug mode only (cmake)
- fix rotation + movement events bug
- add imGui
- make a shadow renderer only that outputs a texture with shadows then merge it later
- propagate uniform blocks to phong_shadow
- deferred shading
- ambient occlusion
- main loop indpendent frame rate
- view frustm culling
- load textured models, check assimp impl
- resources file format
- selection and picking
- terrian deformation
- fluid/water/particle system simulation (*read Fluid Engine Development book*)
- cloud rendering
- rigid body dynamics
